# Scripts <br />
I love to read and write scripts when needed, even if I am an IT Junior in the field.  <br />
  <br />
Some explanation here :  <br />
***Basique.pm***: Perl library that I wrote. Allow me to discover and delete double in a string array and to add [] in the first letter of a word.  <br />
***checkLibUsage.pl***: This script allow me to see if a libary is still used by the computer (deep interest for a company).  <br />
***clean_HPpc.bat***: A long time ago, I used it for a company. They have a lot of new brand PC's and a lot of software were useless back then. So I wrote this to delete every piece of software not needed.  <br />
***clear_iptables.sh***: Allow me to turn off iptables.  <br />
***disableServices_perf.ps1 and enableServices_perf.ps1***: Allow me to disable/enable services I don't need on a windows computer.  <br />
***domain_integration.ps1***: Add the pc to the AD domain (ecole.lan).  <br />
***iptables.sh***: Some iptables that I use on personal servers with Fail2ban.  <br />
***lireConfigTuxedo.pl***: Allow speed reading for tuxedos file (deep interest for a company).  <br />
